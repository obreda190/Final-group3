This is a pseudo-replica of the game show Jeopardy!
3 players will compete in 2 rounds of trivia questions back to back
Each round will consist of 6 categories with five questions apiece
Points range from 200-1000 in the first round and 400-2000 in the second
Players will click any of the buttons on the board to display the corresponding question along with 3 buzzers
The first player to buzz in will have a window appear that contains their name, indicating that they get to answer
The player will type their answer into the text-field and submit it either by clicking the button or hitting the 'ENTER' key
A window will then appear, displaying whether the answer was correct or not
Points will be awarded for correct answers and deducted for incorrect ones
This process repeats until either all questions have been asked, or the round timer ends
