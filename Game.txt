This is a pseudo-replica of the game show Jeopardy!
3 players will compete in 2 rounds of trivia questions back to back
Each round consists of 6 categories with five questions apiece
Points range from 200-1000 in the first round and 400-2000 in the second
Players will click any of the buttons on the board to display the corresponding question
The first player to buzz in will have a window appear that contains their name, indicating that they get to answer
The player will type their answer into the text-field and submit it
Points will be awarded for correct answers and deducted for incorrect ones
This process repeats until the round timer ends
